# Web applications

_Coaching this? Read the coach guidance
[here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/slug/blob/main/materials/universe/distributed_applications/web_applications/HOW_TO_COACH.x.md)_

In this module you will learn to:
  * Explain how HTTP requests and responses work at a high level
  * Write integration tests for a web application
  * Implement web routes using a lightweight web framework
  * Follow a debugging process for a web application

## Sequence

Work through each of these exercises in sequence.

This module is designed to be worked on during a week. Here's a suggested pace — you might
find you need more (or less) time than this to complete the challenges, and that's OK.
 * Day 1: HTTP
 * Days 2 & 3: Flask Challenges
 * Days 4 & 5: HTML & Jinja
 * Solo challenge at the end of the week

## Phase One: HTTP

Go through these exercises and learn about the HTTP protocol and the Request and Response
flow between a client and a server.

1. [Introduction to HTTP](./http_bites/01_intro_to_http.md)
2. [Requests and Responses](./http_bites/02_requests_and_responses.md)
3. [Sending a request with parameters](./http_bites/03_request_parameters.md)

## Phase Two: Flask Challenges

Go through these exercises and learn how to set up and gradually build a program which
exposes a database through HTTP endpoints.

Some of these challenges include [Process Feedback
Challenges](https://github.com/makersacademy/golden-square-in-python/blob/main/pills/process_feedback_challenges.md),
in which you record yourself performing the task and share it with your coach for
feedback. These are tagged with a 📡.

1. [Setting up a Flask project](./challenges/01_setting_up_flask_project.md)
2. [Building routes](./challenges/02_building_a_route.md)
3. [Test-driving routes](./challenges/03_test_driving_a_route.md) 📡
4. [Test-driving routes that interact with a
   database](./challenges/04_test_driving_route_with_database.md) 📡

## Phase Three: Building webpages

1. [Using HTML to create webpages](./html_challenges/01_page_structure.md)
2. [Using templates to return dynamic HTML](./html_challenges/02_using_templates_dynamic_page.md)
3. [Using links to send `GET` requests](./html_challenges/03_using_links.md) 📡
4. [Using forms to send `POST` requests](./html_challenges/04_using_forms.md)
5. [Debugging a web application](./html_challenges/05_debugging.md)
6. [Securing your application](./html_challenges/06_securing_user_input.md)

## Phase Four: Solo challenge

[Work on the Chitter challenge](projects/chitter_challenge.md) and
open a pull request when you're done.

## Going further

This is additional reference material so you can learn to use common features and patterns
implemented as part of web applications.

1. [Modelling and Planning a Web application](./pills/modelling_and_planning_web_application.md)
2. [Creating and Authenticating users](./pills/user_authentication.md)
3. [Loading CSS or static files](./pills/loading_css_or_static_files.md)
