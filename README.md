# Makers Course Content
In projects find the broken (now fixed) blog application which needed to be debugged. Also find the postcode checker app, which needed to be debugged and secured with html_sanitizer.

# Web applications

_Coaching this? Read the coach guidance
[here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/slug/blob/main/materials/universe/distributed_applications/web_applications/HOW_TO_COACH.x.md)_

In this module you will learn to:
  * Explain how HTTP requests and responses work at a high level
  * Write integration tests for a web application
  * Implement web routes using a lightweight web framework
  * Follow a debugging process for a web application

## Sequence

Work through each of these exercises in sequence.

This module is designed to be worked on during a week. Here's a suggested pace — you might
find you need more (or less) time than this to complete the challenges, and that's OK.
 * Day 1: HTTP
 * Days 2 & 3: Flask Challenges
 * Days 4 & 5: HTML & Jinja
 * Solo challenge at the end of the week

## Phase One: HTTP

Go through these exercises and learn about the HTTP protocol and the Request and Response
flow between a client and a server.

1. [Introduction to HTTP](./http_bites/01_intro_to_http.md)
2. [Requests and Responses](./http_bites/02_requests_and_responses.md)
3. [Sending a request with parameters](./http_bites/03_request_parameters.md)

## Phase Two: Flask Challenges

Go through these exercises and learn how to set up and gradually build a program which
exposes a database through HTTP endpoints.

Some of these challenges include [Process Feedback
Challenges](https://github.com/makersacademy/golden-square-in-python/blob/main/pills/process_feedback_challenges.md),
in which you record yourself performing the task and share it with your coach for
feedback. These are tagged with a 📡.

1. [Setting up a Flask project](./challenges/01_setting_up_flask_project.md)
2. [Building routes](./challenges/02_building_a_route.md)
3. [Test-driving routes](./challenges/03_test_driving_a_route.md) 📡
4. [Test-driving routes that interact with a
   database](./challenges/04_test_driving_route_with_database.md) 📡

## Phase Three: Building webpages

1. [Using HTML to create webpages](./html_challenges/01_page_structure.md)
2. [Using templates to return dynamic HTML](./html_challenges/02_using_templates_dynamic_page.md)
3. [Using links to send `GET` requests](./html_challenges/03_using_links.md) 📡
4. [Using forms to send `POST` requests](./html_challenges/04_using_forms.md)
5. [Debugging a web application](./html_challenges/05_debugging.md)
6. [Securing your application](./html_challenges/06_securing_user_input.md)

## Phase Four: Solo challenge

[Work on the Chitter challenge](projects/chitter_challenge.md) and
open a pull request when you're done.

## Going further

This is additional reference material so you can learn to use common features and patterns
implemented as part of web applications.

1. [Modelling and Planning a Web application](./pills/modelling_and_planning_web_application.md)
2. [Creating and Authenticating users](./pills/user_authentication.md)
3. [Loading CSS or static files](./pills/loading_css_or_static_files.md)
