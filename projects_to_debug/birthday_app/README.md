# (Broken) Postcode Checker app

This web application is broken. You have three objectives:

 * Find the bugs and fix them. **You can assume that the tests describe the correct behaviour** (so you shouldn't modify anything in the `spec/` directory)
 * You need to get **all the tests passing**.
 * You need to **run the app manually with your browser** and make sure it works. You can have a look at the user stories below to understand how the program is expected to behave (without bugs). 

## User stories

Note that these user stories are **already implemented** by the app — they're here as guidance for you to understand what the program is about and how it should behave when correct.
